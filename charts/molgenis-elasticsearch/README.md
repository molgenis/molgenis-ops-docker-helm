```
kubectl get pv
```

You can now view the persistent volume claims and the attached volumes.

| NAME | CAPACITY | ACCESS | MODES | RECLAIM | POLICY | STATUS | CLAIM | STORAGECLASS | REASON | AGE |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------------ | ------ | --- |
| pvc-45988f55-900f-11e8-a0b4-005056a51744 | 30G | RWX | | Retain | Bound | molgenis-solverd/elasticsearch-nfs-claim | nfs-provisioner-retain | | | 33d |
| pvc-3984723d-220f-14e8-a98a-skjhf88823kk | 30G | RWO | | Delete | Bound | molgenis-test/elasticsearch-nfs-claim | nfs-provisioner | | | 33d |

You see the ```molgenis-test/molgenis-nfs-claim``` is bound to the volume: ```pvc-3984723d-220f-14e8-a98a-skjhf88823kk```.
